## Project Structure

The project is structured in a simple way, ensuring modularity and ease of development:


### Key Components:

1. **HomePage (`index.tsx`)**:
   - Displays the welcome message with animated text using **Framer Motion**.
   - Includes the smooth role transition effect showing different roles like "Software Engineer" and "Lifelong Learner."
   - Provides a "Download Resume" button with cool styling and a download feature.

2. **Layout Component (`Layout.tsx`)**:
   - Wraps pages with consistent layout elements like the navigation bar.
   
3. **Navbar Component (`Navbar.tsx`)**:
   - A responsive navigation menu, styled with Tailwind CSS, and adapted for both light and dark themes.

### Styling:
The application is styled using **Tailwind CSS** along with custom utility classes. Thereâ€™s a `globals.css` file that contains base styles and manages color variables for light and dark modes.

        --link-hover: #E5E5E5;  /* Hover color for links */
    }
    ```
For dark mode, modify the colors under:

    ```bash
    @media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
        :root {
            --background: #0a0a0a;
            --foreground: #ededed;
